## Artifical Intelligence course at Sofia University (Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics) - winter semester 2020/2021

### For the course we had 8 assignments (mini-projects):
1. **Sliding puzzle** using the *IDA\** algorithm and the *Manhattan distance heuristic*
2. **N-Queens** using the *MinConflicts* (*Random Restart Hill climbing*) algorithm
3. **Travelling Salesman Problem** using a *genetic* algorithm
4. **Tic-Tac-Toe** using the *Minimax* algorithm with *alpha-beta pruning*
5. **Naive Bayes Classifier** 
6. **Decision Tree Classifier** built with the *ID3* (*Top-Down Induction of Decision Trees*) algorithm
7. **K-Means** and **K-Means++** clustering algorithms
8. Simple **Feed-Forward Neural Network** for AND, OR and XOR logic gates
